# WIA1002-JOJOLands

Still in progress. Currently trying to fix the randomOrder class.

UPDATE:

- So far I already fixed everything and it works now. Only need to add the other Joestars' preferences.

Done:
- profile()
- orderHistory()
- orderList()
- jonathanOrder()
- josephOrder()
- jotaroOrder()

Also really sorry I took a long time with my part. I'm trying my best but I don't think I can finish this soon so if anyone is free, please help me T.T

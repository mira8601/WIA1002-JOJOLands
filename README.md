# WIA1002-JOJOLands

Still in progress. Currently trying to fix the randomOrder class.

UPDATE:

I can run the code again but there are a few issues:
- Having trouble with checking same values in orderList for josephOrder(). Can run the code and print order history but the output have similar orders (Joseph does not order the same food twice) //need help here since I tried asking chatGPT and changed my code multiple times but still can't fix it
- For jonathanOrder(), the looping took a long time to check each order which causes the output to keep running without printing order history. Will try to fix this later. (Don't know if this is fixed but I can only run it if I cleaned the build first before running and if the dayNum is less than 5. If dayNum = 10, it will take too long to run)
- The memory usage when generating orders for each customers is too large until it crashes. Therefore, I have to add another ArrayList to orderList for each residents separately. This will take some time since I need to change a lot. I have to fix each Joestar's preferences first.
- I haven't added the other Joestar's preferences yet since it took too much time trying to fix Joseph's and Jonathan's preference. I'll skip their preferences for now and will try to add the other's preferences.

Also really sorry I took a long time with my part. I'm trying my best but I don't think I can finish this soon so if anyone is free, please help me T.T

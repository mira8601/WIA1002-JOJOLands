# WIA1002-JOJOLands

Still in progress. Currently trying to fix the randomOrder class.

UPDATE:

- So far I already fixed everything and it works now. Only need to add giorno's and jolyne's preferences.

Done:
- profile()
- orderHistory()
- orderList()
- jonathanOrder()
- josephOrder()
- jotaroOrder()
- josukeOrder() for this one, I'm not sure if the way I did it is correct or not. Since this preference mentioned 'borrowing money', I'm not sure which food should be added to his order to fit that condition. I just added some of the cheapest menu.
- giornoOrder() almost done

Also really sorry I took a long time with my part.

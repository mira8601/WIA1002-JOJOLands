# WIA1002-JOJOLands

Still in progress. Currently trying to fix the randomOrder class.

UPDATE:

I can run the code again but there are a few issues:
- Having trouble with checking same values in orderList for josephOrder() //need help here since I tried asking chatGPT and changed my code multiple times but still can't fix it
- The memory usage when generating orders for each customers is too large until it crashes. Therefore, I have to add another ArrayList to orderList for each residents separately. This will take some time since I need to change a lot.
- I haven't added the other Joestar's preferences yet since it took too much time trying to fix Joseph's preference. I'll skip Joseph's preference for now and will try to add the other's preferences.

# WIA1002-JOJOLands

Finished. Just need to adjust a few things (the starting part to make it easy to combine with the start interface)

- josukeOrder(): for this one, I'm not sure if the way I did it is correct or not. Since this preference mentioned 'borrowing money', I'm not sure which food should be added to his order to fit that condition. I just added some of the cheapest menu.
- jolyneOrder(): fixed it but haven't checked if the Saturday restaurant is similar to Jotaro's or not.
